In this post, I will show what are the necessary tools to enable working on an embedded platform taking into account that many of the platforms available today are based on procerssors whith ARM architectures.

I will discuss about cross compilation and how to set up a working environment where it is possible to create software that will run in the objective platform.

For this purpose, I have two platforms that where I want to test my software. One of them is the widely known Raspberry pi 3 Model B+ and the other is a lesser know platform but more powerfull VAR-SOM-MX6. Furtunatelly both of them have the same architecture for thir processor, so the application we are going to design, will run in both of them.
